<h1 style="margin-top:-15px;">Funding Gap Filler</h1>
</div>

# Quick Start

This bot tracks changes to a pool so it can put on minority-side trades that collect accrued funding from the majority. The bot helps push markets toward 50/50 skew. This bot takes on price risk.

### Configuration

#### Set Environment Variables

- Set a Solana cluster.
- Set a wallet for the bot.
  - Use a wallet exclusively for this bot that does not have any open positions.
  - Use base58 encoded private key as an environment variable.
  - If PRIVATE_KEY is not found in the environment variables, then the bot defaults to the machine's Solana CLI default keypair.
- Set the pool address.
  - Check the [docs](https://docs.parcl.co/smart-contracts-+-accounts#pools) for pool addresses.
- Set an RPC url to connect to Solana.
  - If you need a url, check out this list of public and private providers [here](https://solana.com/rpc).

### Start Bot

```sh
yarn start
```

# Make it better

- This bot is far from production ready. What would make it better?
- Price risk protection?
- Are the hooks dynamic enough?
