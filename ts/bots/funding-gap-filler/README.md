<h1 style="margin-top:-15px;">Funding Gap Filler</h1>
</div>

# Quick Start

This bot tracks changes to a pool so it can put on minority-side trades that collect accrued funding from the majority. The bot helps push markets toward 50/50 skew. This bot takes on price risk.

- Use a wallet exclusively for this bot that does not have any open positions.
- Check the [docs](https://docs.parcl.co/smart-contracts-+-accounts#pools) for pool addresses.

## Make it better

- This bot is far from production ready. What would make it better?
- Price risk?

## Run Bot

```sh
yarn start
```
